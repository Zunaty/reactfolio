# My React Portfolio

In this project I used React and tailwind CSS, to create a protfolio that shows some of my many works and provide links to my Github, LinkedIn, and resume.

## Future Features

- Users will have their own personal dash board to provide feed back, and track their points, and things to do on the website
- Nav menu fix when in mobile view
